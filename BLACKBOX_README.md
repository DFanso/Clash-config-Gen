## V2Ray Config Generator

### Introduction

This is a simple Node.js script that generates a V2Ray configuration file based on user input. It uses the js-yaml library to parse and generate YAML content, and the readline library to get user input.

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website.

Once you have installed Node.js, you can install the required libraries by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm install js-yaml
npm install readline
```

### Usage

To use the script, clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```
node index.js
```

The script will prompt you for the following information:

* New server value
* New port value
* New uuid value
* A unique name

Once you have entered all of the required information, the script will generate a new V2Ray configuration file based on your input. The configuration file will be saved in the same directory as the script.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The script starts by importing the required libraries.
2. It then defines the YAML content with placeholders for replacements.
3. It reads the YAML content and parses it into a JavaScript object.
4. It gets user input for the replacements.
5. It replaces the placeholders in the YAML content with the user input.
6. It creates a unique output file name based on the servername and name.
7. It saves the updated config to the new YAML file.

### Conclusion

This script is a simple and easy-to-use tool for generating V2Ray configuration files. It can be used by both beginners and experienced users alike.
